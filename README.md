## How to build

You need to cut all the wooden parts from this [schematic](ArcadeGame.PDF). It is best to find a company with the correct equipment to do that for you, as some of the parts are not trivial to cut.

**NOTE:** Ask for the remaining pieces from the wooden parts, as they can be useful when building the arcade.

After the pieces are cut you will end up with a pile of parts that you need to assemble:

Using the [schematic](ArcadeGame.PDF) with all the measurements you need to drill holes in the noted places, so that you can put screws in and get the pieces together. Pick suitable screws for the material you cut the pieces from.
